*** "Implements the cross-entropy (CE) method, which is a model based stochastic optimization
technique to estimate both the number and their corresponding locations of breakpoints
in biological sequences of continuous and discrete measurements."
(Priyadarshana, W. J. R. M., Sofronov G. (2014). Multiple Break-Points Detection in array CGH)

*** general Monte Carlo approach to combinatorial optimization and importance sampling

*** "In a nutshell the CE method consists of two phases:
1) Generate a random data sample (trajectories, vectors, etc.) according to a specified mechanism.
2) Update the parameters of the random mechanism based on the data to produce a "better" sample in the next iteration. This step involves minimizing the cross-entropy or Kullback–Leibler divergence.""

~~~ Package: 'strucchange' ~~~

*** "Computation of breakpoints in regression relationships. Given a number of breaks the function
computes the optimal breakpoints."

*** Uses an object of class Fstats - which is computed by Chow test

~~~ Package: 'partsm' ~~~

*** "This package allows the user to check for periodicity in the data, FFt a periodic autoregressive
model  of  order  p,  PAR(p),  select  the  periodic  autoregressive  lag  order  parameter,  test
for periodic integration, FFt a periodically integrated autoregressive model up to order 2,
PIAR, as well as to perform out-of-sample forecasts."

~~~ Cyclic and seasonal time series ~~~

*** "The class of ETS mod­els (expo­nen­tial smooth­ing within a state space frame­work) allows for sea­son­al­ity but not cyclic­ity"

*** "The class of ARMA mod­els can han­dle both sea­son­al­ity and cyclic behav­iour."

~~~ Package 'kza' ~~~

*** "kza provides Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Adaptive Filters including break detection, spectral analysis, wavelets and KZ Fourier Transforms. multitaper also provides some multitaper spectral analysis tools."

*** Package seems to be a more analytical breakpoint detection - no simple function call for detection or filtering

~~~ Paper: 'Quantifying limits to detection of early warning for critical transitions' ~~~

*** "proposed methods hardly ever characterize their expected error rates"

*** "We propose a model-based approach to quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and
allow comparisons between different indicators"

*** "suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more central part of early warning predictions"

*** "We then illustrate how stochastic differential equation (SDE) models can be used to reflect the
uncertainty inherent in the detection of early warning signals."

*** "Finally, we use receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) [23,24] as a way to illustrate the sensitivity
that different datasets and different indicators have in detecting early warning signals and use this to explore a
number of examples"

~~~ Paper: 'Threshold detection: matching statistical methodology to ecological questions and conservation planning objectives' ~~~

*** file:///home/nathan/Downloads/ACE-ECO-2015-715.pdf

*** "On the basis of their statistical properties, we recommend using piecewise regression methods to identify breakpoint-based thresholds"

*** "Breakpoint based thresholds are characterized by relationships between response and explanatory variable that change at some point, termed a breakpoint (often abrupt, although there can be a smooth transition region around this point; "

*** " In contrast, classification thresholds correspond to a value of the explanatory variable that divides the response variable into two relatively homogeneous groups. Classification thresholds may occur even if there is a gradual change in the response. For example, a threshold may separate ecological conditions where a species is likely to be present versus those where it is likely to be absent"

*** "Breakpoint-based thresholds apply in cases where a change in the relationship between the response and explanatory
variable is of concern"

*** "Classification thresholds apply in cases where you want to partition the response variable based on the explanatory variable"

~~~ Package: 'cumSeg' ~~~

*** "Estimation of number and location of change points in mean-shift (piecewise constant) models. Particularly useful to
model genomic sequences of continuous measurements."

~~~ Package: 'Segmented' ~~~

*** Regression Models with Breakpoints/Changepoints Estimation

*** Given a regression model, segmented `updates' the model by adding one or more segmented (i.e., piecewise-linear) relationships. Several variables with multiple breakpoints are allowed.
