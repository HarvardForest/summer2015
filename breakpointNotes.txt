~~~ Package: 'breakpoint' ~~~

*** "Implements the cross-entropy (CE) method, which is a model based stochastic optimization
technique to estimate both the number and their corresponding locations of breakpoints
in biological sequences of continuous and discrete measurements."
(Priyadarshana, W. J. R. M., Sofronov G. (2014). Multiple Break-Points Detection in array CGH)

*** general Monte Carlo approach to combinatorial optimization and importance sampling

*** "In a nutshell the CE method consists of two phases:
1) Generate a random data sample (trajectories, vectors, etc.) according to a specified mechanism.
2) Update the parameters of the random mechanism based on the data to produce a "better" sample in the next iteration. This step involves minimizing the cross-entropy or Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence.""

~~~ Package: 'strucchange' ~~~

*** "Computation of breakpoints in regression relationships. Given a number of breaks the function
computes the optimal breakpoints."

*** Uses an object of class Fstats - which is computed by Chow test

~~~ Package: 'partsm' ~~~

*** "This package allows the user to check for periodicity in the data, FFt a periodic autoregressive
model  of  order  p,  PAR(p),  select  the  periodic  autoregressive  lag  order  parameter,  test
for periodic integration, FFt a periodically integrated autoregressive model up to order 2,
PIAR, as well as to perform out-of-sample forecasts."
