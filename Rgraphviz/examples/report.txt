The Rgraphviz package is a powerful framework for constructing graphs
(including subgraphs, bipartite graphs, cluster graphs, and networks).

A graph object may assume a handful of different layouts and types (directed or undirected).
Node shapes, colors, text, and a variety of other attributes can be customized.
Edge labels, weights, colors, and a variety of other attributes may also be customized.

Plotting a graph object is modular and default attributes will be applied when not
specified. The package auto-adjusts the plot output based on attribute deffinitions
(including number of edges and nodes, sub-graph clustering, label-length, etc.)

Rgraphviz undoubtedly a well implemented framework, but there doesn't appear to
be a convenient and explicit means of assigning properties to the nodes. The
nodes themselves don't seem to be objects.

This package could be utilized with additional development:
1) Data could be stored as objects, stored in an adjacency matrix, and then
drawn accordingly as a graph. Referencing a specific node could be as simple as
searching the adjacency matrix.
